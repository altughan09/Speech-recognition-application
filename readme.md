# Speech recognition application

I wrote this console based speech recognition program getting inspired by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8xjj6cR9Nc)

Written in Python version 3.6.5

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install project dependencies.

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install playsound
pip install gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
```

## Usage

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
import webbrowser
import playsound
import os
import random
import time
from gtts import gTTS
```
